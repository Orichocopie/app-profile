To avoid spending resources with collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see whether we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our purpose:\n",

A data set containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store. You can download the data set directly from this link. Let's start by opening the two data sets and then continue with exploring the data."
